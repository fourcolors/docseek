- Simplify `src/mastra/tools/doctorRouter.ts`
  1. Review documentation for Zod, JSDoc, and AI SDK tool patterns.
  2. Consider at least 3-5 options for simplification:
     - Option 1: Inline schemas/types, reduce duplication.
     - Option 2: Extract file loading to a helper.
     - Option 3: Merge doctor finding/routing into one function.
     - Option 4: Class-based approach.
     - Option 5: Minimal functional approach with only essential exports.
  3. Pick the best option (most readable, maintainable, concise).
  4. Refactor code: keep Zod validation, JSDoc, and typesafety.
  5. Test and lint to ensure code quality.
